# Integrating Analyzers

- Create a custom directory wherever you want and add it to the `PluginDirectoryPaths` setting of the project file:
```json
{
  "Plugins": {
    "PluginDirectoryPaths": [
      ".\\Plugins",
      "<Relative-Path-to-the-plugin-directory>"
    ]
  }
}
```
- Copy the plugin files to the directory you created in step 1. Do not copy any `DatabaseAnalyzer.*` files to that directory. You can also copy `*.pdb` and `*.deps.json` files.
