Do not use `SELECT *` for existence checks even the SQL query optimizer can handle that. Use `SELECT 1` instead .

**Non-compliant:**

```tsql
SELECT          Id,
                Name
FROM            Employees
WHERE EXISTS
(
    SELECT      * -- Use 1 instead
    FROM        Orders
    WHERE       Employees.EmployeeID = Orders.EmployeeID
                AND OrderDate > '2025-01-01'
);
```

**Compliant:**

```tsql
SELECT          Id,
                Name
FROM            Employees
WHERE EXISTS
          (
              SELECT      1 -- fixed
              FROM        Orders
              WHERE       Employees.EmployeeID = Orders.EmployeeID
                AND OrderDate > '2025-01-01'
          );
```
