Usage of `SELECT *` from a non-derived table or CTE.

**Non-compliant:**

```tsql
SELECT  *
FROM    Table1
```

**Compliant:**

```tsql
SELECT          t1.Id,
                d.* -- d is a derived table
FROM            Table1 AS t1
INNER JOIN
(
    SELECT      Id,
                Value
    FROM        Table2
) AS d ON       d.Id = t1.Id
```
