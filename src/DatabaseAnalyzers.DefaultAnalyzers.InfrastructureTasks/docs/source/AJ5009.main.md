Use `CREATE OR ALTER` whenever possible.

**Non-compliant:**

```tsql
CREATE VIEW dbo.V1
AS
SELECT 1 AS Expr1
```

```tsql
CREATE PROCEDURE P1
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT 1
END
```

```tsql
CREATE FUNCTION F1()
    RETURNS INT
AS
BEGIN
    RETURN 1
END
```

**Compliant:**

```tsql
CREATE OR ALTER VIEW dbo.V1
AS
SELECT 1 AS Expr1
```

```tsql
CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE P1
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT 1
END
```

```tsql
CREATE OR ALTER FUNCTION F1()
    RETURNS INT
AS
BEGIN
    RETURN 1
END
```
