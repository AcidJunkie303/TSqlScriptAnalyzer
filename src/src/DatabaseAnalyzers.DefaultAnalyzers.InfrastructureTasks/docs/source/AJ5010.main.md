Use spaces for better readability. E.g. after commas or before and after operators.

Non-compliant:

```tsql
SELECT 1,2,3 -- missing spaces after comma
```

```tsql
SELECT  *
FROM    Table1
WHERE   Id=1 -- missing spaces before and after '='
```

Compliant:

```tsql
SELECT 1, 2, 3
```

```tsql
SELECT  *
FROM    Table1
WHERE   Id = 1
```
